## Introduction to Node.js
ECMA Script- Refers to the standard language
Javascript- is what we use in practice and builds on top of EMCA script
#### Java runtime Engines
<ol><li>V8- it is the open source engine developved by google for chrome</li>
    <li>Spider Monkey- is a Javascript engine powering Firefox Browswer
    <li>Javascript Core- is a Javascript engine developed by Apple and Safari
    <li>Chakra- was the Javascript engine created for the original Microsoft Edge, but the latest Microsoft Edge uses the V8</li></ol>
<b>NB</b>: We can embedd the V8 engine into the C++ program and it will run the users Javascript code.
C++ program is the <b>NodeJS</b>

##### Node.JS
Node.js is for sharing code and data structures seamlessly between the front-end and back-end
For example where an attack algorithm is executed on the front end and validated on the back end to prevent cheating, maintaining identical algorithms is imperative.
The use of code sharing and the unification of the front-end and back-end in a common language yield significant advantages in terms of overall development efficiency and maintainability.
    <ul><li>File Handling
        <li>Database Connection
        <li>Network Operations
        <li>Shared library
        <li>Custom function or algprithms
        <li>Data Structures or object defination</li></ul>

##### Advantages of JavaScript
 Unlike other languages in different environments, JavaScript simplifies data transfer from the back end to the front end without requiring intricate conversions.

  <ul><li>Front-end and back-end share language
          <li>Front-end and Back-end share code
          <li>Dynamic
          <li>Works well with JSON
          <li>Custom function or algprithms</li></ul>
